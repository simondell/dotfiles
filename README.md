# dotfiles

My shell and system configurations, based on {Zach Holman's](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).

1. install a fresh macOS
2. log in, do all the iCloud stuff
3. clone this directory `git clone git@github.com:simondell/dotfiles.git`
4. macOS will get to installing command-line tools (phew)
5. curse as you realise you haven't created an SSL cert for this new machine
6. follow the steps: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/
7. don't forget to add the new key to github
8. goto 3 'til that's done
9 `cd dotfiles`
10. `./script/bootstrap`
11. relax!
12. if softwareupdate finds updates, it may make you restart
