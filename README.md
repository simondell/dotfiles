# theOtherDell's dotfiles

Dotfiles are collections of terminal, application and system settings. They help a developer maintain a comfortable and familiar working environment across multiple machines (or across rebuilds of the same machine). They sometimes include scripts for automatically configuring a system to use the collection, or for installing software.

These are mine.

I've taken inspiration and copied scripts from {Zach Holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).
