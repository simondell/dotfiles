# theOtherDell's dotfiles

Dotfiles are collections of terminal, application and system settings. They help a developer maintain a comfortable and familiar working environment across multiple machines (or across rebuilds of the same machine). They sometimes include scripts for automatically configuring a system to use the collection, or for installing software.

These are mine.

I've taken inspiration and copied scripts from {Zach Holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles). In fact, I've borrowed so much, that it should have been a fok. However, I wanted to learn how Zach's scripts worked, so I took little sips from his brew as I went along rather than downing the whole lot in one.
